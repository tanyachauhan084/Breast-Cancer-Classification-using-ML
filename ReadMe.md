# 🧠 Logistic Regression Classification Model

A machine learning classification project using Logistic Regression that achieves **98.82% accuracy on training data** and **98.24% on testing data** — demonstrating excellent generalization without overfitting.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves building and evaluating a Logistic Regression model on a labeled dataset to predict a target variable. The goal was to achieve high performance while maintaining generalization between training and testing datasets.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Format**: Structured CSV
- **Target variable**: `y` 
- **Features**: Multiple numerical features
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Missing value handling
  - Feature scaling (`StandardScaler`)
  - Train-test split 

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.13
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn (`LogisticRegression`, `StandardScaler`, `train_test_split`)
- Jupyter Notebook

---


## 🔍 Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Scaler**: StandardScaler
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - `random_state=42` (for reproducibility)
